# SimplePaint
Very simple networked paint application written in Java SE & Swing

## Server part:
Execute Server.jar or BoardServer.class and you're good to go. Control it with list, create, erase and exit commands.
This likely won't work if you just double-click "Server.jar", please use terminal or .bat file.

## Client part:
Execute Client.jar or Launcher.class, type in an address of host and you'll be presented with list of drawing boards. Choose one or create new one and you're good to go.
